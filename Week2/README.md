# Introduction Assignments 
-----

Each of the folders in this section contain the various programming assignments for week 2 of the course.  The prog_assign.pdf file contains the instructions for each problem.
  
## Small Fibonacci Numbers
------

The fibonacci folder contains code to solve the following problem

> The Fibonacci numbers are defined as follows: F0=0, F1=1, and Fi = F(i-1) + F(i-2) for i >= 2.
 
>Task: Given an integer n, find the nth Fibonacci number Fn

>Constraints: 0 <= n <= 45

>Time Limits: C: 1 sec, C++: 1 sec, Java: 1.5 sec, Python: 5 sec. C#: 1.5 sec, Haskell: 2 sec, JavaScript:
  3 sec, Ruby: 3 sec, Scala: 3 sec.
  
## Last Digit of a Large Fibonacci Number
------

The fibonacci_last_digit folder contains code to solve the following problem

## Greatest Common Divisor
------

The gcd folder contains code to solve the following problem


>The greatest common divisor GCD(a, b) of two non-negative integers a and b (which are not both equal to 0)
is the greatest integer d that divides both a and b.

>Task: Given two integers a and b, find their greatest common divisor.

>Input Format: The two integers a, b are given in the same line separated by space.

>Constraints: 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 2 · 10 9 .
