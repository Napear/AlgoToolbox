# Introduction Assignments 
-----

Each of the folders in this section contain the various programming assignments for week 2 of the course.  The prog_assign.pdf file contains the instructions for each problem.
  
## Small Fibonacci Numbers
------

The fibonacci folder contains code to solve the following problem

> The Fibonacci numbers are defined as follows: F0=0, F1=1, and Fi = F(i-1) + F(i-2) for i >= 2.
 
>Task: Given an integer n, find the nth Fibonacci number Fn

>Constraints: 0 <= n <= 45
