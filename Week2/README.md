# Introduction Assignments 
-----

Each of the folders in this section contain the various programming assignments for week 2 of the course.  They each contain code stubs from the course material in C, Java and Python.  My solutions are added to some of those files, and constitute the whole of any other files.  The prog_assign.pdf file contains the instructions for each problem.
  
## Small Fibonacci Numbers
------

The fibonacci folder contains code to solve the following problem

> The Fibonacci numbers are defined as follows: F0=0, F1=1, and Fi = F(i-1) + F(i-2) for i >= 2.
 
> Given an integer n, find the nth Fibonacci number Fn

>Constraints: 0 <= n <= 45
