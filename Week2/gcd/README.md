------

The gcd folder contains code to solve the following problem


>The greatest common divisor GCD(a, b) of two non-negative integers a and b (which are not both equal to 0)
is the greatest integer d that divides both a and b.

>Task: Given two integers a and b, find their greatest common divisor.

>Input Format: The two integers a, b are given in the same line separated by space.

>Constraints: 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 2 · 10 9 .
