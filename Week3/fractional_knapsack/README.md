## Fractional Knapsack
------

Given a set of items and total capacity of a knapsack, find the maximal value of fractions of items that fit
into the knapsack.

>Task: The goal of this code problem is to implement an algorithm for the fractional knapsack problem.

>Input Format: The first line of the input contains the number n of items and the capacity W of a knapsack. The next n lines define the values and weights of the items. The i-th line contain integers v i and w i — the value and the weight of i-th item, respectively.

>Constraints: 1 ≤ n ≤ 10 3 , 0 ≤ W ≤ 2 · 10 6 ; 0 ≤ v i ≤ 2 · 10 6 , 0 < w i ≤ 2 · 10 6 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n. All the numbers are integers.

>Time Limits: C: 1 sec, C++: 1 sec, Java: 1.5 sec, Python: 5 sec. C#: 1.5 sec, Haskell: 2 sec, JavaScript: 3 sec, Ruby: 3 sec, Scala: 3 sec.
