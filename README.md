# AlgoToolbox
------

This is a repo to contain my solutions for the Algorithmic Toolbox course available on Coursera.com.  The full course content can be found at <https://www.coursera.org/learn/algorithmic-toolbox>
All of the programming assignments are designed to be run at the command line.  Each requires a specific inputs though STDIN (given for each problem) and they then return the output via STDOUT.

## Week 1
------

The programing assignments for week 1 on are not included as they are trivial in nature and design only to teach how to submit programming assignments through the courses grading interface

## Week 2
------

This is the "introductory" week and contains code to find Fibonacci numbers, to compute a gcd and to compute an lcd.
